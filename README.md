Chrome Faster Top Bookmark
======================

Simple chrome extension that adds a new browser button to quickly add bookmarks to the top of the selected category (with fewer mouse clicks then using the native 'star' button)

TODO
====

 - options (font size and style, focus style, key bindings, sorting options)
 - subcategory indentation?
 
 
 TODO from zorkyy:
 - Publish to the Marketplace
 - cyrillic layout search support

Installation
====

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Now drag and drop the extension from your file manager anywhere onto the extensions page in Chrome. If the extension is a .crx file you will be asked to review the permissions and add the extension.
3. Done! The extension is installed and you are ready to go. You can now manage the extension as you would any other, and its icon will appear in the Chrome Menu (if it has one) to the right of the address bar.
4. Note that every time you restart Chrome, the first new window will present a notice about the security risks of developer mode. To leave the extensions enabled, click “Cancel.” This is a bit of a nuisance, but it’s only one click!
